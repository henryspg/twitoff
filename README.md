twitoff: flask web app for comparing Twitter users

8/18:  
Try to refresh / update the browser.  Worked after updating BASILICA, import models, & many things


8/19:
* Create prediction, make list of 2 users
* Test the code based on a given text: who is more likely that person who tweet? Compare them.
* Update sqlite DB with all the names in the lists, and I added 2 more names (JimmyKimmel, BarackObama, StephenCurry30)
* Add some code to make that happen (auto update)
* Knowing how "embedding' works.
* understand why we put only 2 usernames (in the code) to compare.
* replace twitoff.py with app.py
